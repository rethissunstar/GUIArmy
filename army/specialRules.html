    <span class="bold">And They Shall Know No Fear:</span>

    modifiers
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Angels of Death:</span>
    This unit has the following abilities: And They Shall Know No Fear, Bolter
    Discipline, Shock Assault and Combat Doctrines.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Assault Doctrine:</span>
    The Armour Penetration characteristic of Pistol and melee weapons this model
    is equipped with is improved by 1 whilst this combat doctrine is active.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Bolter Discipline:</span>
    Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, models in this
    unit shooting Rapid Fire bolt weapons make double the number of attacks if
    any of the following apply<br />
    <br />
    - The shooting model&apos;s target is within half the weapon&apos;s range<br />
    - The shooting model is Infantry (excluding Centurion models) and it&apos;s
    unit Remained Stationary in your previous Movement Phase.<br />
    - The shooting model is a Terminator or Biker<br />
    <br />
    For the purposes of this ability, a Rapid Fire bolt weapon is any bolt
    weapon (see page 195) with the Rapid Fire type.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Combat Doctrines:</span>
    (See page 125 of Codex Space Marines)
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Devastator Doctrine:</span>
    The Armour Penetration characteristic of Heavy and Grenade weapons this
    model is equipped with is improved by 1 whilst this combat doctrine is
    active.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Fire Discipline:</span>
    While the Tactical Doctrine is active for your army, INFANTRY models from
    your army (excluding DEATHWING models) can make attacks with Rapid Fire and
    Assault Weapons (excluding Blast weapons) while within Engagement Range of
    enemy units, but must target an enemy unit that is within Engagement Range
    of its own unit when they do so. In such circumstances, the model can target
    an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of
    the same enemy unit, and while it is making such an attack, it has a
    Ballistic Skill characteristic of 5+.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Grim Resolve:</span>
    Each time a model with this tactic makes an attack, unless that model&apos;s
    unit has moved this turn (excluding pile-in and consolidation moves), add 1
    to that attack&apos;s hit roll. Each time a Combat Attrition test is taken
    for this unit, it is automatically passed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Implacable:</span>
    While the Assault Doctrine is active for your army, each time a DEATHWING
    INFANTRY or DEATHWING DREADNOUGHT model from your army makes a melee attack
    against a CHARACTER unit or unit that contains any models with a wounds
    characteristic if 8 or more, you can re-roll the wound roll.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Shock Assault:</span>
    Each time this unit fights if it made a charge move, was charged or
    performed a Heroic Intervention this turn, then until that fight is
    resolved, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in this unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Speed of the Raven:</span>
    While the Devastator Doctrine is active for your army:<br />
    • Add 3&quot; to the Move characteristic of RAVENWING models from your
    army.<br />
    • RAVENWING units from your army are eligible to shoot with in a turn in

    a turn in which it Advanced, that attack suffers the penalty incurred to the
    hit roll as if firing an assault weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Tactical Doctrine:</span>
    The Armour Penetration characteristic of Rapid Fire and Assault weapons this
    model is equipped with is improved by 1 whilst this combat doctrine is

  <h2>Selection Rules</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Acts of Faith:</span>
    One Miracle Die is generated at the start of each Player Turn.<br />
    <br />
    Once per phase, one unit from your army with this ability can perform one
    Act of Faith using Miracle dice on the following dice rolls:<br />
    Advance, Charge, Hit, Wound, Saving throw, Damage; Morale test<br />
    <br />
    There&apos;s an ENTIRE PAGE of rules for Acts of Faith/Miracle dice in the
    Codex on page 91. I&apos;m not typing that in, and you should have them
    memorized by now, anyway.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Angels of Death:</span>
    This unit has the following abilities: And They Shall Know No Fear, Bolter
    Discipline, Shock Assault and Combat Doctrines.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Astartes Grenade Launcher:</span>
    Before selecting targets, select one of the following profiles to make
    attacks with.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Combat Squads:</span>
    Before any models are deployed at the start of the game, this unit when
    containing its maximum number of models, may be split into two units each
    containing an equal number of models.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Combi Weapon:</span>
    When attacking with this weapon, choose one or both of the profiles. If you
    choose both, subtract 1 from all hit rolls for this weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Death from Above:</span>
    During deployment, if every model in this unit has this ability, then you
    can set up this unit high in the skies instead of setting it up on the
    battlefield. If you do, then in the Reinforcements step of one of your
    Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is
    more than 9&quot; away from enemy models.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Explodes (3&quot;/1):</span>
    When this model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play. On a
    6 it explodes and each unit within 3&quot; suffers 1 mortal wound.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Explodes (6&quot;/D3):</span>
    When this model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play. On a
    6 it explodes and each unit within 6&quot; suffers D3 mortal wounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Inner Circle:</span>
    If this unit has the Grim Resolve Chapter Tactic, or it has the Inheritors
    of the Primarch Successor tactic and it is using the Chapter Tactic of the
    Dark Angels, then:<br />
    • Each time a Morale test is taken for this unit, it is automatically
    passed.<br />
    • While this unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy FALLEN units,
    unless this unit has the VEHICLE keyword, this unit cannot be selected to
    Fall Back.<br />
    • Each time you select this unit to Fall Back, unless it has the VEHICLE,
    RAVENWING or CHAPTER MASTER keywords, roll 2D6: if the result is less than
    or equal to the unit’s Leadership characteristic it can Fall Back, otherwise
    it cannot Fall Back and must Remain Stationary instead.<br />
    • Each time an attack is made against this unit, if this unit has the
    INFANTRY keyword, an unmodified wound roll of 1-3 always fails, irrespective
    of any abilities that the weapon or the model making that attack may have.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Jink:</span>
    If this unit has the Grim Resolve Chapter Tactic, or it has the Inheritors
    of the Primarch Successor Tactic, and it is using the Chapter Tactic of the
    Dark Angels, then:<br />

    your Movement phase, if this unit Remains Stationary, it loses this
    invulnerable save until the start of your next Movement phase.<br />
    • Each time this unit Advances, until the start of your next turn, models in
    this unit have a 4+ invulnerable save against ranged attacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Sacred Rites:</span>
    This unit gains a bonus depending on which sacred rites are active for your
    army. After players have determined their mission, you must select one
    sacred rite from the following table to be active for your army.
    Alternatively, you can randomly determine two sacred rites from the table to
    be active for your army by rolling two D6 and looking up the results (if a
    double is rolled, roll both dice again until two different results are
    rolled). In either case, these sacred rites are active for your army until
    the end of the battle. Some rules can make additional sacred rites become
    active for a unit during the battle. Duplicated active sacred rites on that
    unit have no additional effect.<br />
    <br />
    1. Hand of the Emperor:<br />
    While this sacred rite is active, add 1 to Advance rolls and charge rolls
    made for this unit.<br />
    <br />
    2. Spirit of the Martyr:<br />
    While this sacred rite is active, each time a model in this unit is
    destroyed by a melee attack and does not explode, roll one D6, on a 6, after
    the attacking model&apos;s unit has finished making its attacks, it suffers
    1 mortal wound (a unit can suffer a maximum of 6 mortal wounds per phase as
    the result of this ability).<br />
    <br />
    3. Aegis of the Emperor:<br />
    While this sacred rite is active, each time this units uses its Shield of
    Faith ability to take a Deny the Witch test, if the result of that test was
    an unmodified result of 5+, or it it was greater than the result of the
    Psychic test, that Deny the Witch test is passed.<br />
    <br />
    4. Divine Guidance:<br />
    While this sacred rite is active, each time a model in this units makes a
    ranged attack, on an unmodified wound roll of 6, the Armour Penetration
    characteristic of that attack is improved by 1.<br />
    <br />
    5. The Passion:<br />
    While this sacred rite is active, each time a model in this unit makes a
    melee attack, an unmodified hit roll of 6 scores 1 additional hit.<br />
    <br />
    6. Light of the Emperor:<br />
    While this sacred rite is active, you can ignore any or all modifiers to
    this unit&apos;s Leadership characteristic, and each time a Combat Attrition
    test is taken for this unit, you can ignore any or all modifiers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Shield of Faith:</span>
    Models in this unit have a 6+ invulnerable save.<br />
    <br />
    In your opponent&apos;s Psychic phase, this unit can attempt to deny one
    psychic power as if it were a PSYKER. Each time a Deny the Witch test is
    take for this unit, roll one D6 instead of 2D6: if the result of that test
    was an unmodified result of 6, or if it was greater than the result of the
    Psychic test, that Deny the Witch test is passed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Teleport Strike:</span>
    During deployment, you can set up this model in a teleportarium chamber
    instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the end of any of your Movement
    phases this model can teleport into battle - set it up anywhere on the
    battlefield that is more than 9&quot; away from any enemy models.
